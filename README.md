# sp500_dca_vs_timing

For some time, I thought that it could be a good idea to invest into the stock market after it drops for two consecutive days. This was mainly to the fact that is tends to grow in the long term and so any drops would eventually be just temporary and would pose a good chance for a market entry at a lower price level.

The assumption that I wanted to test was:
If there are two consecutive days of market drop larger than 1%, would a market entry on the day after be a strategy that could beat the commonly proposed DCA (Dollar-Cost-Averaging) method, which basically consists of regular deposits regardless of the market conditions?

I used the probably most commonly recommended index for passive stock market investing - the S&P500. This index is tracking the performance of the largest 500 companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.

Note:
I am supposing a deposit, which is placed before the market opens and thus executed at the open price on the given day.
